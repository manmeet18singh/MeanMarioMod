# The Mean Mario Mod
Games are heavily criticized today for equal representation. Many games are disliked for “pushing an LGBT agenda” on players. Games that try to force equality often make players upset, while creating a rippling divide between communities. 

In the Mean Mario Mod you start off creating your own character. We think games need a more diverse and in depth character creation tool so that the players can play comfortably. The mod will have options for race, gender, and sexuallity, however the gameplay will not be affected by any of these choices, and changing the characters sexuallity will not visually change the characters appearance. That way, we are expressing that your character’s race, gender, and sexuality are miniscule to the challenges you face ahead. After creating a character that the player is comfortable with, we are introduced to arguably the most iconic video game level, Super Mario Bros’ World 1-1. You would play this level like any normal level of Super Mario however the enemies on screen will be saying real comments/tweets that criticizing elements of the character creator (race, gender, sexuality). We will do away with violence as in you will not be able to jump on enemies to kill them... instead when you touch the enemy you lose a heart. The objective of the game is to get to the end of the world without losing all your hearts. You need to be able to traverse the world, being above (literally) the hatred that lies ahead.
